# EPUB to Audiobook Converter

This project provides a command-line tool to convert EPUB ebooks into audiobooks. It now supports both the [Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-text-to-speech) and the [OpenAI Text-to-Speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech) to generate the audio for each chapter in the ebook. The output audio files are optimized for use with [Audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf).

*This project is developed with the help of ChatGPT.*

- [OpenAI TTS Sample](https://audio.com/paudi/audio/openai-0008-chapter-vii-agricultural-experience-i-had-now-been-in)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ Or ***Docker***
- For using Azure TTS, A Microsoft Azure account with access to the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech Services](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices) is required.
- For using OpenAI TTS, OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) is required.

## Audiobookshelf Integration

The audiobooks generated by this project are optimized for use with [Audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf). Each chapter in the EPUB file is converted into a separate MP3 file, with the chapter title extracted and included as metadata.

### Chapter Titles

Parsing and extracting chapter titles from EPUB files can be challenging, as the format and structure may vary significantly between different ebooks. The script employs a simple but effective method for extracting chapter titles, which works for most EPUB files. The method involves parsing the EPUB file and looking for the `title` tag in the HTML content of each chapter. If the title tag is not present, a fallback title is generated using the first few words of the chapter text.

Please note that this approach may not work perfectly for all EPUB files, especially those with complex or unusual formatting. However, in most cases, it provides a reliable way to extract chapter titles for use in Audiobookshelf.

When you import the generated MP3 files into Audiobookshelf, the chapter titles will be displayed, making it easy to navigate between chapters and enhancing your listening experience.

  output_folder         Path to the output folder

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --tts {azure,openai}  Choose TTS provider (default: azure). azure: Azure
                        Cognitive Services, openai: OpenAI TTS API. When using
                        azure, environment variables MS_TTS_KEY and
                        MS_TTS_REGION must be set. When using openai,
                        environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY must be set.
  --log LOG             Log level (default: INFO), can be DEBUG, INFO,
                        WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  --preview             Enable preview mode. In preview mode, the script will
                        not convert the text to speech. Instead, it will print
                        the chapter index, titles, and character counts.
  --language LANGUAGE   Language for the text-to-speech service (default: en-
                        US). For Azure TTS (--tts=azure), check
                        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/speech-service/language-
                        support?tabs=tts#text-to-speech for supported
                        languages. For OpenAI TTS (--tts=openai), their API
                        detects the language automatically. But setting this
                        will also help on splitting the text into chunks with
                        different strategies in this tool, especially for
                        Chinese characters. For Chinese books, use zh-CN, zh-
                        TW, or zh-HK.
  --newline_mode {single,double}
                        Choose the mode of detecting new paragraphs: 'single'
                        or 'double'. 'single' means a single newline
                        character, while 'double' means two consecutive
                        newline characters. (default: double, works for most
                        ebooks but will detect less paragraphs for some
                        ebooks)
  --chapter_start CHAPTER_START
                        Chapter start index (default: 1, starting from 1)
  --chapter_end CHAPTER_END
                        Chapter end index (default: -1, meaning to the last
                        chapter)
  --output_text         Enable Output Text. This will export a plain text file
                        for each chapter specified and write the files to the
                        output folder specified.
  --remove_endnotes     This will remove endnote numbers from the end or
                        middle of sentences. This is useful for academic
                        books.

Azure TTS Options:
  --voice_name VOICE_NAME
                        Voice name for the text-to-speech service (default:
                        en-US-GuyNeural). You can use zh-CN-YunyeNeural for
                        Chinese ebooks.
  --break_duration BREAK_DURATION
                        Break duration in milliseconds for the different
                        paragraphs or sections (default: 1250). Valid values
                        range from 0 to 5000 milliseconds.
  --output_format OUTPUT_FORMAT
                        Output format for the text-to-speech service (default:
                        audio-24khz-48kbitrate-mono-mp3). Support formats:
                        audio-16khz-32kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-16khz-64kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-16khz-128kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-24khz-48kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-24khz-96kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-24khz-160kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-48khz-96kbitrate-mono-mp3
                        audio-48khz-192kbitrate-mono-mp3. See
                        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-

                        speech?tabs=streaming#audio-outputs. Only mp3 is
                        supported for now. Different formats will result in
                        different audio quality and file size.

OpenAI TTS Options:
  --openai_model OPENAI_MODEL
                        Available OpenAI model options: tts-1 and tts-1-hd.
                        Check https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-
                        speech/audio-quality.
  --openai_voice OPENAI_VOICE
                        Available OpenAI voice options: alloy, echo, fable,
                        onyx, nova, and shimmer. Check
                        https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-
                        speech/voice-options.
  --openai_format OPENAI_FORMAT
                        Available OpenAI output options: mp3, opus, aac, and
                        flac. Check
                        https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-
                        speech/supported-output-formats.
```  

**Example**:

```bash
python3 epub_to_audiobook.py examples/The_Life_and_Adventures_of_Robinson_Crusoe.epub output_folder
```

Executing the above command will generate a directory named `output_folder` and save the MP3 files for each chapter inside it. Once generated, you can import these audio files into [Audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) or play them with any audio player of your choice.

## Preview Mode

Before converting your epub file to an audiobook, you can use the `--preview` option to get a summary of each chapter. This will provide you with the character count of each chapter and the total count, instead of converting the text to speech.

**Example**:

```bash
python3 epub_to_audiobook.py examples/The_Life_and_Adventures_of_Robinson_Crusoe.epub output_folder --preview
```

## Using with Docker

This tool is available as a Docker image, making it easy to run without needing to manage Python dependencies.

First, make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

You can pull the Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/p0n1/epub_to_audiobook:latest
```

Then, you can run the tool with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ./:/app -e MS_TTS_KEY=$MS_TTS_KEY -e MS_TTS_REGION=$MS_TTS_REGION ghcr.io/p0n1/epub_to_audiobook your_book.epub audiobook_output --tts azure
```

For OpenAI, you can run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ./:/app -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY ghcr.io/p0n1/epub_to_audiobook your_book.epub audiobook_output --tts openai
```

Replace `$MS_TTS_KEY` and `$MS_TTS_REGION` with your Azure Text-to-Speech API credentials. Replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key. Replace `your_book.epub` with the name of the input EPUB file, and `audiobook_output` with the name of the directory where you want to save the output files.

The `-v ./:/app` option mounts the current directory (`.`) to the `/app` directory in the Docker container. This allows the tool to read the input file and write the output files to your local file system.

**You can also check the [this example config file](./docker-compose.example.yml) for docker compose usage.**

## Customization of Voice and Language

You can customize the voice and language used for the Text-to-Speech conversion by passing the `--voice_name` and `--language` options when running the script.

Microsoft Azure offers a range of voices and languages for the Text-to-Speech service. For a list of available options, consult the [Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=tts#text-to-speech).

You can also listen to samples of the available voices in the [Azure TTS Voice Gallery](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/voicegallery) to help you choose the best voice for your audiobook.

For example, if you want to use a British English female voice for the conversion, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 epub_to_audiobook.py <input_file> <output_folder> --voice_name en-GB-LibbyNeural --language en-GB
```

For OpenAI TTS, you can specify the model, voice, and format options using `--openai_model`, `--openai_voice`, and `--openai_format`, respectively.
